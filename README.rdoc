... query_param() in notes.js -- does it unescape?

the way the exitWarning is cancelled on note save is weird?

add like #formatted_date= to note, don't break apart the param in notes_controller.rb

add like #set_filter to notes_controller.rb, call it at top of index

what is NotesController#show ?
